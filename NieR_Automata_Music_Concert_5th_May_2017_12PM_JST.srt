Credits to /u/ilfans for the translation, thank you!

2
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:11,024
Enjoy watching :)

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Pod 042 : Everything that lives is designed to end

4
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:29,024
"They" are perpetually trapped ...

5
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:32,448
... in a never-ending spiral of life and death.

6
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,972
Is this a curse?

7
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:38,596
Or some kind of punishment?

8
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,320
"They" often think about the god who blessed "them" with this cryptic puzzle ...

9
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:48,344
... and wonder if they'll ever have the chance to kill him.

10
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:54,468
2B: When I met him "that time",

11
00:23:54,492 --> 00:23:59,392
it was during our mission to destroy the Goliath-class weapon.

12
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:01,916
9S: You're 2B, right?

13
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,440
My name's 9S. I'm here to provide support.

14
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:12,664
2B: The No.9 Type S model is a high-end model.

15
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:18,188
And it's because of that there's a constant danger of
them coming into contact with confidential information.

16
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:24,912
That's why I've been tasked with the duty of eliminating him ...

17
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:28,236
Over ... and over ...

18
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,760
But ... The 9S of that time, he was somewhat different.

19
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:43,784
9S: Scanners like me mostly work alone. Scouting out enemy lines and all that?

20
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:49,808
So, I don't usually get a partner. It's kind of fun!

21
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:55,732
2B: I simply ignored him when he'd speak.

22
00:24:55,856 --> 00:25:01,356
If I were to grow close to him, it'd only become more difficult to kill him.

23
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,280
Even so, he wouldn't stop trying to make conversation with me.

24
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:14,704
9S: Say, 2B? Don't you think this white flower would look good on you?

25
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:15,928
2B: I have no need for it.

26
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,252
9S: Aw, are you sure?

27
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:21,676
2B: Attaching a plant to my hair would do nothing for my combat abilities.

28
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,000
 Rather, it would more likely cause maintenance failure.

29
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,624
9S: Hahah. Man, 2B, you're way too serious, you know that?

30
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:37,048
2B : I made a promise with 9S in the past.

31
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:44,172
A promise that I'd continue to kill him, without fail.

32
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:50,596
The 9S from back then, and the 9S before me are two different people.

33
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,220
That fact ... makes my chest tighten.

34
00:25:56,644 --> 00:26:00,544
Pod 042: Pod 042 to YoRHa unit 2B.

35
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:08,668
Report: Detecting errors occurring within unit 2B's memory
region, likely due to unstable psychological state.

36
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:14,492
Proposal: Moderate rest should cause improvement.

37
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:19,316
2B: I've already been aware of that for a long time ...

38
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,940
But ... the day I'm freed from this pain ... will be the day I die.

39
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:30,764
Pod 042: Mail notification received from Command.

40
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:36,188
2B: I wonder if I was afraid.

41
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:41,112
Or perhaps... I was wrong.

42
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:50,736
Even so, I continued on by his side, without even knowing the name of the emotion I'd been feeling.

43
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,400
9S: 2B and I first met in one of the hallways in the Bunker.

44
00:41:51,824 --> 00:41:57,224
I'd received an announcement from the Commander that I'd be working with a partner this time.

45
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,948
However... I was a little uneasy about it.

46
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:07,872
Scanner models like me usually work alone. And ...

47
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:13,496
 I'd always gotten the impression that No.2 models were somewhat cold.

48
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:23,420
So when she said those things to me in the hallway, I was ... kind of surprised.

49
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,344
2B: 9S?

50
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:26,768
9S: Yeah?

51
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,492
2B: Thank you...

52
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:34,816
For uploading my data to the Bunker.

53
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,640
9S: I’m sorry... I don’t have any memory of doing that.

54
00:42:40,764 --> 00:42:44,964
There wasn't a whole lot of bandwidth down there, you know?

55
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:52,088
 I probably only had enough time to back up your memories.

56
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:59,812
Mine are only intact up to the point just before we rendezvoused.

57
00:43:00,336 --> 00:43:02,336
2B: ... I see.

58
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:09,660
9S: Things started out so awkward. At least, until that day ...

59
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:14,584
It happened after a battle.

60
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:19,008
Pod 042: Confirming the annihilation of all machine lifeforms in this area.

61
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:20,432
9S: Whew ...

62
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:23,856
2B: So we've destroyed every machine lifeform here?

63
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,880
Pod 042: Affirmative: No responses from any machine lifeforms in this area.

64
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,404
2B: Understood.

65
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:35,628
9S: Huh? Hey, 2B ... did something happen to your right hand?

66
00:43:35,652 --> 00:43:41,952
2B: My right hand ...? Oh, this. I must've injured my finger during the previous battle.

67
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:44,576
9S: Gah! You're — You're bleeding!

68
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,200
Pod! Get me staunching gel and logic-virus vaccines! Then — uh —

69
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:53,724
Pod 042: Inadvisable. There is a high probability that excessive
treatment will cause a decrease in movement efficiency to the unit ...

70
00:43:53,748 --> 00:43:55,748
9S: Just shut up and do it already!

71
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:57,772
2B: ... 9S, don't you think you're overreacting?

72
00:43:57,796 --> 00:43:59,796
9S: Huh? Not you too, 2B!

73
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,620
2B: Just leave it. The nano machines will heal it just fine on their own.

74
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,644
9S: Er, I guess so ...

75
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:09,968
Pod 042: Confirmation of mission completion by enemy annihilation.

76
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:13,092
Recommendation: Report results to Command.

77
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:16,316
9S: Um ... 2B?

78
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,940
2B: What is it?

79
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,764
9S: You think we could at least use the staunching gel?

80
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:31,488
If contaminants enter the blood stream they'll be difficult to remove, and if it's just staunching
gel, then it shouldn't cause any problems to your motor functions, so, you know, just in case ...

81
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:32,512
2B: ... All right.

82
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,236
9S: Got it! Then I'll go ahead and prepare it right away!

83
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,260
9S: Now where's that case ...

84
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:38,684
2B: 9S.

85
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:39,808
9S: Yeah?

86
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:42,732
2B: ... Thank you.

87
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:49,756
9S: I can't remember anymore what my response was when she said that.

88
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:58,480
Just that I was so happy to be useful to someone.

89
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:06,704
What was most important to me ... was being together with 2B.

90
00:45:07,828 --> 00:45:09,828
 ... At least.

91
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:21,852
Until the day that YoRHa fell, along with the Bunker ...

92
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,900
Pod 042: Large-scale attack ended in failure. The Bunker has collapsed.

93
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:31,024
Black-box signal for YoRHa unit 2B offline. Death confirmed.

94
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:38,848
A large "tower" produced by machine lifeforms rose within the city ruins.

95
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:48,072
Having lost a place to return to, unit 9S aimed
for nothing more than the top of that "tower".

96
00:59:49,296 --> 00:59:55,296
In order to destroy the machine lifeforms which caused this nightmare.

97
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,820
And to end himself as well.

98
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:04,344


99
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:10,468
9S: I have to ... apply the vaccine ...

100
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:14,192
Pod 042: The virus corrodes his body.

101
01:00:14,716 --> 01:00:17,216
His thought process breaks down.

102
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:25,240
Sound recordings found in the flooded city play back in his mind.

103
01:00:26,064 --> 01:00:32,764
2B: 9S ... The time I was able to spend with you ...

104
01:00:33,288 --> 01:00:40,688
It was like memories of pure light ...

105
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:48,712
Thank you ... Nine ... s ...

106
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:02,476
Pod 042: Those memories are his greatest treasure.

107
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:05,830
Living together, fighting together.

108
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:11,002
They were like a family.

109
01:01:12,314 --> 01:01:14,914
9S: 2B ...

110
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:21,812
Pod 042: 9S holds that recording deep within his heart.

111
01:01:22,317 --> 01:01:27,384
Treating it as if it were truly a treasure.

112
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:35,587
9S: 2B ... I ... I'll be with you before long ...

113
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:39,411
Pod 042: Reality and fiction blend together.

114
01:01:39,923 --> 01:01:47,223
With clouded consciousness, unit 9S carries himself forward, his legs heavy.

115
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:51,847
He'll defeat as many enemies as possible, even if he is alone.

116
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:57,871
As if in response to that wish, a new enemy appears.

117
01:02:00,595 --> 01:02:04,695
Many enemies appear in front of him.

118
01:02:04,919 --> 01:02:08,719
They're ... androids.

119
01:02:08,743 --> 01:02:13,143
They're ... YoRHa units.

120
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,900
9S: 2B models?

121
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:21,124
Pod 042: The person he treasures above all else.

122
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:25,895
Someone who resides in a location out of his reach.

123
01:02:35,074 --> 01:02:42,241
I'm glad I got to see you here. I truly am.

124
01:02:44,065 --> 01:02:50,165
I'll tear you apart ... Every last one of you!

125
01:02:50,692 --> 01:02:54,592
Pod 042: 9S draws his sword.

126
01:02:54,803 --> 01:03:06,603
Pod 042: Is this an act of murderous intent? Or is it
perhaps done out of love? It's no longer possible to tell.

127
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:45,439
Pod 042: Contamination from the logic virus is getting worse.

128
01:23:46,091 --> 01:23:53,258
Nearly 80% of his memory is contaminated, and his thought circuits are severely damaged.

129
01:23:53,282 --> 01:23:57,282
9S: Dammit ... I can't ... remove ...

130
01:23:57,506 --> 01:24:02,006
The vaccine ... it'll no longer ...

131
01:24:02,187 --> 01:24:09,820
Pod 042: Unit 9S knows that there's only one solution left that could dispel the contamination.

132
01:24:10,299 --> 01:24:17,732
To lock his personal data and reformat his entire system.

133
01:24:18,956 --> 01:24:23,956
To throw away all of his current memories, and be reborn anew.

134
01:24:23,949 --> 01:24:27,482
9S: No !... I can't do that ...

135
01:24:27,506 --> 01:24:35,206
No matter how contaminated I become ... I can't lose this memory ...

136
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:41,430
If that's my only choice ... then I'm better off dead!

137
01:24:42,392 --> 01:24:46,459
Pod 042: 9S is fighting with fear itself.

138
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:53,349
To have one's personal data contaminated means to lose one's ability to think for themself.

139
01:24:53,999 --> 01:25:00,799
To androids, that is a fate worse than death.

140
01:25:01,023 --> 01:25:06,123
9S: I am who I am ... because of 2B ...

141
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:12,450
I have a reason to live ... because of those memories ...

142
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:20,574
So ... please ... don't take them from me ...

143
01:25:22,429 --> 01:25:29,296
Pod 042: To him, calling her his family was much too silly.

144
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:34,422
But calling her his lover was much too distant.

145
01:25:34,447 --> 01:25:43,580
9S: Machines ... A2 ... It doesn't matter ... I'll kill every last one of you!

146
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:47,411
2B ...

147
01:25:47,944 --> 01:25:49,644
 I ...

148
01:25:52,742 --> 01:25:56,575
Pod 042: Within the corners of his eroding consciousness,

149
01:25:56,655 --> 01:26:03,322
9S continues to protect his memories of 2B.

150
01:26:04,031 --> 01:26:13,198
Even if ... his actions are completely meaningless in the eyes of the world.

151
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:20,970
2B: I am ... No.2 ... Type E.

152
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:27,863
I was created to execute my fellow YoRHa soldiers.

153
01:26:28,365 --> 01:26:30,365
9S: I'd already ...

154
01:26:31,427 --> 01:26:36,760
I'd already realized that ...

155
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:41,891
2B: The mission I had been assigned over and over again...

156
01:26:43,004 --> 01:26:47,437
Was to kill you, 9S.

157
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:54,413
9S: Stop it ... Enough already ... 2B.

158
01:26:55,737 --> 01:27:01,304
Even if you were trying to kill me, I ...

159
01:27:01,453 --> 01:27:08,253
Being with you, it truly ...

160
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:15,410
... It felt like I'd found a family.

161
01:27:18,304 --> 01:27:22,604
2B: Hey ... 9S?

162
01:27:24,064 --> 01:27:29,597
I wonder ... Were the choices we made wrong?

163
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,747
Pod 042: Within a pure white tower.

164
01:27:37,371 --> 01:27:40,571
A small boy walks.

165
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,823
Suffering. Uneasy.

166
01:27:47,465 --> 01:27:54,232
Holding within him many small, important memories.

167
01:27:55,271 --> 01:28:01,038
They're of ... the time the two of them spent together.

168
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:10,224
His memories of those days ... were most precious to him.
