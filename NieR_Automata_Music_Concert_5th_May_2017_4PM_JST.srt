Credits to /u/ilfans for the translation, thank you!

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:06,024
Enjoy watching :)

3
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,074
Pod 153: Everything that lives is designed to end.

4
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:09,712
"We" are perpetually trapped ...

5
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:14,130
... in a never-ending spiral of life and death.

6
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,479
Is this a curse?

7
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,013
Or some kind of punishment?

8
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:23,293
I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle ...

9
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:27,226
... and wonder if "we'll" ever have the chance to kill him.

10
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:32,025
(September 5th)

11
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:35,687
Pod 042: Unit 2B's vital signs confirmed.

12
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:44,229
Memory storage, thought circuits, auxiliary motor
functions, all confirmed to have been restarted.

13
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:47,240
Entering reboot sequence.

14
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,377
Good morning, 2B.

15
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,881
2B: I ...

16
00:22:54,981 --> 00:23:05,075
Pod 042: Report: Unit 2B was killed by unit A2 approximately 1718 hours ago.

17
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:11,728
2B: 1718 hours ago ... So ... 72 days, then.

18
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:17,772
Pod 042: Following that, us tactical support units reconstructed your parts.

19
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:29,326
The virus previously inside you deactivated along
with the tower's collapse, and remains in suspension.

20
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:33,288
2B: Tower ...? What happened ...?

21
00:23:33,465 --> 00:23:34,465
Ah!! 9S ...!!

22
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:42,174
Pod 153: Report: Unit 9S ceased activity approximately 740 hours ago.

23
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:45,045
2B: Pod ... 153?

24
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:54,705
Pod 153: Unit 9S was severely contaminated, however said virus
deactivated along with the tower's collapse, and remains in suspension.

25
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:59,154
2B: So he's just ... asleep?

26
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,955
Pod 153: Negative: An error occurred during unit 9S's reboot sequence.

27
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,754
2B: What do you mean, an error ...?

28
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:14,333
Pod 153: Unknown: All checks were completed, however his personal data
will not begin loading procedures, causing an inability to reboot.

29
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:23,305
2B: His personal data won't load ... Then in that case, run
the monitoring sequence, and skip the check sequence ...

30
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:30,303
Pod 153: Negative: This unit has already attempted 345
combinations 34,500 times, and all have ended in failure.

31
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:37,763
Pod 153: Unit 9S's current state suggests there is a possibility
his personal data has been lost due to some unknown cause.

32
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:41,772
2B: His personal data is ... lost ...?

33
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:47,577
Pod 153: Proposal: Unit 2B should consider disposing of unit 9S's body.

34
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:51,977
2B: There's no way I could ... just dispose of his body ...!

35
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:56,202
Pod 153: ... Understood.

36
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:06,404
2B: After being reconstructed, there wasn't even a hint of dirt on 9S's body ...

37
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:11,536
His face ... looked just like he was sleeping.

38
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:21,328
I took my weapon in hand, and packed the minimum
necessary provisions, before standing up.

39
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,632
I had to go.

40
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:30,243
There had to be a way to get 9S to reboot properly.

41
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:34,371
That's what I believed.

42
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,222
September 14th.

43
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:39,714
2B: I received information on what happened while I was gone from the pods.

44
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:46,409
About A2 ... and 9S.

45
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:55,363
I also heard about how the two of them destroyed some huge
"Tower" that had been created by the machine lifeforms.

46
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:03,305
The rubble from it is still scattered all throughout the city.

47
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:08,923
The City Ruins' landscape had been completely changed.

48
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:14,096
Pod 042: Proposal: Unit 2B should gather information at the resistance camp.

49
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:21,118
2B: The resistance camp was able to miraculously
avoid damage from the collapse of the tower ...

50
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:32,301
However Devola and Popola, and a few others in the
resistance, lost their lives in the fight with the machines.

51
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:38,465
Even though Anemone was faced with such a difficult
situation, she still remained level-headed.

52
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:50,414
I tried speaking to Anemone about the situation with 9S's rebooting,
but she wasn't able to provide me with any helpful information.

53
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:54,778
Pod 153: Report: Relevant records within the Bunker have been lost.

54
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:59,648
2B: We YoRHa units are a special type.

55
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:06,609
We contain something other androids don't within us — a Black Box.

56
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:11,696
And due to that, we're capable of much higher functionality.

57
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:21,627
However, unlike general androids, our maintenance
is only able to be done on the Bunker.

58
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:36,977
It's possible to make easy repairs with the small amount of materials and programs at access points,
but detailed information about the insides of our bodies was lost along with the fall of the Bunker.

59
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:44,855
Even so, I was traveling from place to place looking for the information I needed.

60
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:48,889
No matter ... how long it took.

61
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:55,291
Pod 042: Alert: Unit 2B is taking damage due to maintenance failure.

62
00:42:55,576 --> 00:43:01,226
Proposal: Unit 2B should perform proper repair and replenish materials.

63
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:08,861
2B: With how tired I was, even doing simple first aid felt troublesome.

64
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:17,090
In the depths of my heart, I started to feel
like ... everything I was doing was meaningless.

65
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,860
I don't ... care anymore.

66
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:26,618
I wonder if ... 9S will ever wake up.

67
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:32,588
That sort of dark thought process began to take over.

68
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,059
And I shook my head.

69
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:45,620
I couldn't give up. I couldn't give up. I couldn't give up.

70
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:52,116
Even if I was just deceiving myself, I couldn't admit that.

71
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:57,350
It caused my body to become heavy.

72
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:07,583
If I go further away from here, I may be
able to find surviving YoRHa members.

73
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:10,711
Pod 153: Report: Mail notification received.

74
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,863
2B: ... Check it.

75
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,671
Pod 153: Sender: Jackass.

76
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:22,071
Subject: About 9S's Personal Data Reboot.

77
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:25,213
Yo, how's it going, 2B?

78
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,620
I know a little something about 9S's condition.

79
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:35,175
I've been looking into a lot of things since everything
happened, and I came across some concerning information.

80
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:40,460
There were some logs remaining in the access port outside of 9S's memory storage.

81
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:46,484
They were a communication record from the "Ark" object those machine lifeforms made.

82
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:52,069
I don't know anything about that "Ark" thing, but it might be some sort of server.

83
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:56,039
I'll send you the time and coordinates that were written in that log right away.

84
00:44:56,047 --> 00:45:00,520
There might be a hint somewhere in them.

85
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:07,445
This concludes the body of the email. Time and
three-dimensional coordinate data is attached.

86
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,880
2B: Those coordinates ... were right in the area where the Tower collapsed.

87
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:12,919
September 17th

88
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:23,461
2B: Mountains and mountains of white rubble, as far as I could see.

89
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:30,337
I'd arrived at the center of where the Tower collapsed.

90
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:35,013
And it was there, where I began digging.

91
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:40,987
Pod 153: Hypothesis: Origin point is 40 meters below the current point.

92
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:45,417
Pod 042: Proposal: Search for a more efficient method for digging.

93
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:53,451
2B: That's right, the coordinates Jackass sent me
pointed right to a location within the Tower's rubble.

94
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:59,209
I was digging through it so I could reach the position she gave me.

95
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:07,714
But the material was much more firm than I expected it
to be, and my digging wasn't going particularly well.

96
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:15,842
My breath began to show, and before I'd realized it, it was snowing.

97
01:00:16,926 --> 01:00:22,629
It seems the Tower's rubble was absorbing the
surrounding area's heat and causing the area to cool.

98
01:00:23,325 --> 01:00:31,103
According to the pods, it was made of materials derived from the bodies
of machine lifeforms, which centered around silicon, among other things.

99
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:35,986
But that didn't matter.

100
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:40,551
I only cared about my digging.

101
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:46,652
Pod 153: Hypothesis: Origin point is 25 meters below the current point.

102
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:52,109
Pod 042: Alert: Unit 2B is taking damage due to maintenance failure.

103
01:00:53,424 --> 01:00:58,198
2B: The Tower's materials became
increasingly firm the further down I went.

104
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:10,455
I was using my weapon to dig, but I had to stop using my one-handed sword to switch to
something better suited, and I proceeded downward by practically crushing the materials.

105
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:17,646
I continued on, my mind devoid of any other thoughts, until I finished.

106
01:01:20,084 --> 01:01:23,699
I could feel an ache run through my pain sensors.

107
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:30,698
But it was only thanks to that pain that I was able to keep my sanity.

108
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:37,318
Pod 153: Hypothesis: Origin point is 12 meters below the current point.

109
01:01:37,506 --> 01:01:43,084
Pod 042: Alert: Unit 2B is taking damage due to maintenance failure.

110
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:51,229
Alert: If no proper repair is performed, it will cause severe impact to the unit's body.

111
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:58,543
2B: As I continued to dig, I found out what that "Ark" really was.

112
01:01:59,377 --> 01:02:04,878
It seemed to be a huge memory unit, made by combining complex crystals.

113
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:13,440
However, as it'd been shattered to pieces, I couldn't find a single "living" crystal.

114
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:19,750
Regardless, I continued digging in search of the Ark's crystals.

115
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:31,923
With each swing of my weapon, blood began to scatter.

116
01:02:23,814 --> 01:02:29,614
I couldn't feel my fingertips anymore, and
the sensors running from my wrists had died.

117
01:02:32,308 --> 01:02:37,740
The bolts I'd used to forcibly fix it were starting to dig into my skin.

118
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:45,548
But that didn't matter.

119
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:44,959
Somewhere up ahead, the information I needed to save 9S was ...

120
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:51,397
Even if only a little remains of the Ark, I ... I have to ...!!

121
01:02:54,779 --> 01:03:01,300
Pod 042: Alert: Unit 2B entered forced shutdown due to overload.
