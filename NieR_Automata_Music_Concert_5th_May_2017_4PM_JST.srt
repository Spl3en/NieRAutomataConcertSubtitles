Credits to /u/ilfans for the translation, thank you!

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:06,024
Enjoy watching :)

3
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,074
Pod 153: Everything that lives is designed to end.

4
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:09,712
"We" are perpetually trapped ...

5
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:14,130
... in a never-ending spiral of life and death.

6
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,479
Is this a curse?

7
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,013
Or some kind of punishment?

8
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:23,293
I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle ...

9
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:27,226
... and wonder if "we'll" ever have the chance to kill him.

10
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:32,025
(September 5th)

11
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:35,687
Pod 042: Unit 2B's vital signs confirmed.

12
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:44,229
Memory storage, thought circuits, auxiliary motor functions, all confirmed to have been restarted.

13
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:47,240
Entering reboot sequence.

14
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,377
Good morning, 2B.

15
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,881
2B: I ...

16
00:22:54,981 --> 00:23:05,075
Pod 042: Report: Unit 2B was killed by unit A2 approximately 1718 hours ago.

17
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:11,728
2B: 1718 hours ago ... So ... 72 days, then.

18
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:17,772
Pod 042: Following that, us tactical support units reconstructed your parts.

19
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:29,226
The virus previously inside you deactivated along with the tower's collapse, and remains in suspension.

20
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:33,288
2B: Tower ...? What happened ...?

21
00:23:33,465 --> 00:23:34,465
Ah!! 9S ...!!

22
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:42,174
Pod 153: Report: Unit 9S ceased activity approximately 740 hours ago.

23
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:45,045
2B: Pod ... 153?

24
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:54,705
Pod 153: Unit 9S was severely contaminated, however said virus
deactivated along with the tower's collapse, and remains in suspension.

25
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:59,154
2B: So he's just ... asleep?

26
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,955
Pod 153: Negative: An error occurred during unit 9S's reboot sequence.

27
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,754
2B: What do you mean, an error ...?

28
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:14,333
Pod 153: Unknown: All checks were completed, however his personal data will not begin loading procedures, causing an inability to reboot.

29
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:23,305
2B: His personal data won't load ... Then in that case, run
the monitoring sequence, and skip the check sequence ...

30
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:30,303
Pod 153: Negative: This unit has already attempted 345
combinations 34,500 times, and all have ended in failure.

31
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:37,763
Pod 153: Unit 9S's current state suggests there is a possibility
his personal data has been lost due to some unknown cause.

32
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:41,772
2B: His personal data is ... lost ...?

33
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:47,577
Pod 153: Proposal: Unit 2B should consider disposing of unit 9S's body.

34
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:51,977
2B: There's no way I could ... just dispose of his body ...!

35
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:56,202
Pod 153: ... Understood.

36
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:06,404
2B: After being reconstructed, there wasn't even a hint of dirt on 9S's body ...

37
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:11,536
His face ... looked just like he was sleeping.

38
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:21,328
I took my weapon in hand, and packed the minimum
necessary provisions, before standing up.

39
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,632
I had to go.

40
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:30,243
There had to be a way to get 9S to reboot properly.

41
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:34,371
That's what I believed.
